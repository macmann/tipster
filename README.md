# Monorepo Project

This repository contains three Node.js projects managed as workspaces:

- **backend** – Express API service.
- **frontend** – Next.js web application.
- **telegram-bot** – Telegram bot service.

Each folder contains its own `package.json` created with `npm init -y`. The source files are placeholders for further development.
